The thread further suggested that a likely explanation for this alleged observation was the cremation of bodies associated with the outbreak of the new coronavirus whose origin is in that region:\n\nThe Sun and The Express, among other outlets, uncritically repeated this claim, despite its dubious origins. Both outlets later deleted their stories without a correction note by the time of our reporting. The Sun, for example, had described the above image as showing the \u201cextent of corpse burning in Wuhan.\u201d That premise is fatally flawed for at least two reasons.\nFirst and most significantly: The data presented are not a real-time observation of sulfur concentrations above Wuhan. Instead, the image is a computer-model output designed to predict, based on a historical knowledge of the area and its current atmospheric conditions, what concentration of sulfur is likely present in the air at a given time and place. Second, sulfur is not a significant emission from human cremation. It is, however, a significant emission from the burning of coal in power plants or for other industrial uses like iron and steel production. The area directly below the hotspot shown in Twitter thread is, in fact, the Wuhan Iron & Steel Company.\nProblem One: Not an Actual Observation of Sulfur Dioxide Concentrations\nThe source of the data highlighted in the Twitter thread is a company named Windy.com, which combines several models and meteorological inputs to create global maps of weather conditions aimed primarily at people who partake in outdoor sports. Windy, in turn, gets its sulfur data from a NASA climate model named GEOS-5. Arlindo da Silva, a research meteorologist at NASA\u2019s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office, told the British fact-checking organization Full Fact that the GEOS-5 sulphur dioxide models do not \u201cassimilate real satellite data\u201d into their forecasts.\nInstead, he said, \u201cOur forecasts are based on fixed emission inventories,\u201d which \u201cdo not account for the day-to-day variations in SO2 emissions and as such cannot account for sudden changes in human activity.\u201d The sulfur fluctuations present in the GEOS-5 model stem from \u201cvariations in the meteorological conditions, in particular winds.\u201d The high levels of industry in the region \u2014 the Wuhan Iron & Steel Company \u2014 are likely the cause of higher \u201cemission inventories\u201d prescribed by the model for the Wuhan region.\nProblem Two: Sulfur Emissions Are Not A Significant Factor in Cremation\nThe viral twitter thread asserts that \u201csulfur dioxide [is] commonly associated with the burning of organic matters.\u201d This is a technically correct statement that is grossly misleading in this context. Sulfur dioxide is commonly associated with the burning of coal. Coal, formed from the carbon compounds of dead plant material buried and heated naturally in the earth for millions to hundreds of millions of years, is indeed an example of \u201corganic matter\u201d that, when burned, can release sulfur dioxide.\nHumans, while also an example of organic matter, nevertheless contain a negligible amount of sulfur. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus make up more than 99% of all chemicals in the human body, leaving less than 1 percent for anything else, including sulfur. The sulfur present in coal dominantly comes from geologic processes that occur over millions of years. As such, a recently deceased body, when burned, is not going to generate an abundance of sulfur compounds even if there were live satellite measurements to document that release of chemicals (which there are not).\nCremation and the Coronavirus\nNone of this is to say that there has not been an increase in cremation in areas in China affected by the spread of the coronavirus. On Feb. 2, 2020, the Chinese government announced that it was banning all funerals for victims of the viral infection, further stipulating that cremation would be required for their bodies.\nHowever, the suggestion that satellite data provides a measurable signal of increases in cremation relies on two fundamental misunderstandings about both the atmospheric model at issue and the chemistry used to interpret it. As such, we rate this claim as \u201cFalse.\u201d": "Poukazuj\u00fa emisie s\u00edry z \u010d\u00ednskeho mesta Wu-chan na masov\u00fa krem\u00e1ciu obet\u00ed koronav\u00edrusu?\nD\u00e1tov\u00e1 mapa, ktor\u00e1 sa objavila v popul\u00e1rnom vl\u00e1kne Twitter, neukazovala, \u010do niektor\u00ed \u013eudia tvrdia.\n8. febru\u00e1ra 2019 dobre zdie\u013ean\u00e9 vl\u00e1kno Twitteru tvrdilo, \u017ee \u201e\u00fadaje\u201c ukazuj\u00fa mas\u00edvne zv\u00fd\u0161enie emisi\u00ed s\u00edry v \u010d\u00ednskom meste Wuhan.

The number of coronavirus cases reported in this video (approximately 40,000) was taken from an interactive guide created by the University of Washington. While that was likely accurate when this video was released on Feb. 12, as of this writing, the number of reported coronavirus cases has grown to more than 80,000.\nWhile the coronavirus is rightly causing concern around the globe, WHO has attempted to quell some of those fears. On a web page dedicated to information about the outbreak, WHO wrote on Feb. 23 that if you don\u2019t live in, or have traveled recently to, an area where coronavirus is spreading, your chances of getting the disease are currently low:\nIf you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of those areas or have not been in close contact with someone who has and is feeling unwell, your chances of getting it are currently low.

It\u2019s a good idea to get the facts to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions. Your healthcare provider, your national public health authority and your employer are all potential sources of accurate information on COVID-19 and whether it is in your area.

The letter is attributed to pathologist James Robb who described himself as \u201cone of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses.\u201d The letter itself provides common-sense solutions to preventing disease transmission:\n1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.\n2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.\n3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip \u2013 do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.\n4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.\n5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been.\n6) Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home\u2019s entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can\u2019t immediately wash your hands.\n7) If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!\nThe portion of the missive that garnered the most attention, however, was the pathologist\u2019s recommendation of zinc lozenges:\nStock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY \u201ccold-like\u201d symptoms beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available.\nThis portion of the letter apparently resulted in memes suggesting the product Cold-Eeze was a \u201csilver bullet\u201d that would \u201ckill coronavirus\u201d:\n\nAnalysis\nWe reached out to Robb to ask if he was the author of this letter. Via email, he told us that he did indeed write it, but that it was never meant to be for anyone besides family and close friends, and that it was not intended to be an advertisement for any specific product:\nIt was my email to my family and close friends ONLY. Someone put it on their Facebook page. It was intended to be a monologue \u2013 not a dialogue. I do not use any social media and may have been too naive about what \u201csharing\u201d means today.\nHis history with coronaviruses is accurately recounted. In the late 1970s, as professor of pathology at the University of California, San Diego, Robb published some of the earliest descriptions of coronaviruses. He also published a book chapter on this class of viruses for \u201cComprehensive Virology.\u201d\nWhile Robb does recommend zinc lozenges (of any brand, he told us), he would not describe the product as the silver bullet solution to the outbreak:\nIn my experience as a virologist and pathologist, zinc will inhibit the replication of many viruses, including coronaviruses. I expect COVID-19 [the disease caused by the novel coronavirus] will be inhibited similarly, but I have no direct experimental support for this claim. I must add, however, that using zinc lozenges as directed by the manufacturer is no guarantee against being infected by the virus, even if it inhibits the viral replication in the nasopharynx.\nIn general terms, research suggests that zinc may be able to inhibit the spread of some viral infections, but the question remains scientifically unsettled. A 2010 study using cell cultures published in PLOS One found evidence that increasing intracellular zinc concentrations \u201ccan efficiently impair the replication of a variety of RNA viruses\u201d including coronaviruses. According to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, \u201ctrials conducted in high-income countries since 1984 investigating the role of zinc for the common cold symptoms have had mixed results.\u201d The common cold is caused by a virus also classified as a coronavirus.\nBecause the letter was written by him, we rank this claim as \u201cCorrectly Attributed\u201d to Robb.

The post began with this text:\nI\u2019m a doctor and an Infectious Diseases Specialist. I\u2019ve been at this for more than 20 years seeing sick patients on a daily basis. I have worked in inner city hospitals and in the poorest slums of Africa. HIV-AIDS, Hepatitis,TB, SARS, Measles, Shingles, Whooping cough, Diphtheria \u2026 there is little I haven\u2019t been exposed to in my profession. And with [the] notable exception of SARS, very little has left me feeling vulnerable, overwhelmed or downright scared.\nI am not scared of Covid-19. I am concerned about the implications of a novel infectious agent that has spread the world over and continues to find new footholds in different soil. I am rightly concerned for the welfare of those who are elderly, in frail health or disenfranchised who stand to suffer mostly, and disproportionately, at the hands of this new scourge. But I am not scared of Covid-19.\nThe post, which can be read in full here, implores the public not to succumb to panic in response to the new coronavirus, which is responsible for the disease COVID-19 and first discovered in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Sharkawy\u2019s post continues:\nCovid-19 is nowhere near over. It will be coming to a city, a hospital, a friend, even a family member near you at some point. Expect it. Stop waiting to be surprised further. The fact is the virus itself will not likely do much harm when it arrives. But our own behaviors and \u201cfight for yourself above all else\u201d attitude could prove disastrous.\nI implore you all. Temper fear with reason, panic with patience and uncertainty with education. We have an opportunity to learn a great deal about health hygiene and limiting the spread of innumerable transmissible diseases in our society. Let\u2019s meet this challenge together in the best spirit of compassion for others, patience, and above all, an unfailing effort to seek truth, facts and knowledge as opposed to conjecture, speculation and catastrophizing.\nWe reached out to Sharkawy via a University Health System email address found in the University of Toronto directory to confirm that he was indeed the author of the post. In response he told us, \u201cI\u2019m your man.\u201d\nAccording to the University of Toronto, Sharkawy completed his training in internal medicine at the University of Toronto and in infectious diseases at the University of British Columbia. A biography of Sharkawy penned for his role as a judge for a scholarship competition suggests his extensive volunteer experience is factual, as well:\nAbdu Sharkawy is an Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases consultant and Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto. He has been a longstanding volunteer with experience involving several charitable organizations and those committed to social justice pursuits, including Amnesty International, the United Way and Doctors without Borders. He is a founding member of the Welcome Medical Clinic which served countless \u2026 refugees and newcomers to Canada who had no medical insurance coverage prior to recently reformed legislation.\nBecause he confirmed his authorship of this viral post, we rank it as \u201cCorrectly Attributed\u201d to Sharkawy.": "Nap\u00edsal \u0161pecialista na infek\u010dn\u00e9 choroby \u201eNem\u00e1m strach z COVID-19\u201c?\n\u010citatelia sa p\u00fdtali na v\u00edrusov\u00fd pr\u00edspevok na Facebooku v obdob\u00ed prepuknutia nov\u00e9ho koronav\u00edrusu v roku 2020.\nAbdu Sharkawy, konzultantka intern\u00e9ho lek\u00e1rstva a infek\u010dn\u00fdch chor\u00f4b v Torontskej univerzitnej zdravotn\u00edckej sieti a pomocn\u00fd profesor na University of Toronto, sa 6. marca 2020 stal v\u00edrusov\u00fdm a z\u00edskal viac ako 1,3 mili\u00f3na akci\u00ed v \u010dase n\u00e1\u0161ho hl\u00e1senia.

The assertion in this viral \u201cadvice,\u201d however, is that if the virus were already in your mouth, water would help wash it away. Though medical officials recommend drinking water during any infection, no evidence exists to support the notion that sipping water prevents a virus from infecting the respiratory system.\nDrinking more water, while good for your overall health, will not keep anyone from catching the coronavirus, according to Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University. Schaffner told The Associated Press, \u201cWe always caution anyone healthy and people who are sick to keep up fluid intake and keep mucus membranes moist.\u201d He also said: \u201cIt makes you feel better; there is no clear indication that it directly protects you against complications.\u201d\nDr. Susan Wootton, an infectious disease expert at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth, agreed with that assessment, telling KHOU that no data exist to support the claim that sipping water will prevent infection by transporting it to the stomach.\nBecause no evidence supports the claim, we rank the notion that sipping water regularly prevents COVID-19 infection as \u201cFalse.\u201d": "Zabr\u00e1ni pop\u00edjanie vody ka\u017ed\u00fdch 15 min\u00fat infekcii koronav\u00edrusom?\nT\u00e1to \u201eseri\u00f3zna vynikaj\u00faca rada japonsk\u00fdch lek\u00e1rov, ktor\u00ed sa zaoberaj\u00fa pr\u00edpadmi COVID-19\u201c, nie je a\u017e tak\u00e1 vynikaj\u00faca.\nNepresn\u00e9 spr\u00e1vy o novom koronav\u00edruse sa \u0161\u00edria a mutuj\u00fa online.

How can you know if you are infected? By the time you have fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% fibrosis. Taiwan experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning: Take a deep breath and hold it for more than 10 seconds. If you do this successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, there is no fibrosis in the lungs; it basically indicates no infection. In critical times, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air.\nStanford Health Care, for their part, explicitly stated they had nothing to do with the email:\nA widely distributed email about COVID-19 that is attributed to a \u201cStanford Hospital board member\u201d contains inaccurate information. It did not come from Stanford Medicine.\nThe viral text is often combined with other frequently recurring coronavirus claims including a paragraph attributed to \u201cserious excellent advice by Japanese doctors\u201d about keeping your throat moist, and a set of recommendations that begins with a claim about differentiating between a cold and COVID-19. Snopes addressed the \u201cserious excellent advice\u201d here, and addressed the list of tips that begin with a purported way to diagnose a cold versus COVID-19 here. This article deals only with the \u201cself-check\u201d claim attributed to Taiwan experts, which is flawed for several reasons.\nThe \u201csimple self-check\u201d hinges on two central and unsupported assertions: First, that early COVID-19 infections include as a symptom a condition known as pulmonary fibrosis; and second, that the ability to hold your breath for 10 seconds is an accurate indicator of fibrosis. Neither is the case.\nPulmonary Fibrosis Is Not a Symptom of COVID-19\nFibrosis occurs when excess connective tissue is deposited in the lungs in response to scarring or other factors. This excess of tissue can severely reduce the ability of lungs to bring oxygen to the body. To date, no major health agency has listed fibrosis as a symptom of COVID-19 at any stage in its progression. It is not listed as a symptom in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) \u201cClinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease,\u201d nor is it listed as a symptom in the World Health Organization\u2019s joint report with China on the progression and spread of the disease.\nWhile serious cases of COVID-19 usually involve pneumonia, which can cause scarring damage to the lungs, such damage would necessarily come after one showed obvious symptoms of pneumonia. The \u201cself-check,\u201d even if it had any diagnostic power at all, illogically implies damage to the lungs would precede other symptoms including coughing, even though it is the coughing that would be responsible for any respiratory damage in the first place.\nHolding Your Breath Is Not a Valid Test for Pulmonary Fibrosis\nThe viral claim asserts that if you can hold your breath for more than 10 seconds \u201cwithout discomfort, stiffness or tightness, there is no fibrosis in the lungs\u201d and that this \u201cbasically indicates no infection.\u201d\nWhile holding your breath is likely harder if your lung capacity is reduced, there is no scientific support for the notion that holding your breath for 10 seconds indicates a clean bill of health, nor is there support for the implied assertion that the only reason holding your breath for 10 seconds would be hard is because COVID-19 caused pulmonary fibrosis.\u00a0 Several factors can reduce lung function, including allergies, asthma, chronic conditions, and infections. As such, there are multiple forms of respiratory tests that doctors perform on lungs to identify problems. None of them involves one\u2019s ability to hold their breath for 10 seconds.\nBecause holding your breath is not a valid test for fibrosis, and because fibrosis is not a symptom of COVID-19, we rank this advice from \u201cTaiwan experts\u201d as \u201cFalse.\u201d": "Nie, zadr\u017eiavanie dychu nie je \u201ejednoduchou samokontrolou\u201c pre Coronavirus\nZhlboka sa nad\u00fdchnite a pora\u010fte sa s najnov\u0161\u00edmi pokynmi CDC alebo WHO predt\u00fdm, ako za\u010dnete s ak\u00fdmiko\u013evek \u201eradami\u201c koronav\u00edrusov na soci\u00e1lnych sie\u0165ach.\nPreto\u017ee sa nov\u00fd koronav\u00edrus, ktor\u00fd je zodpovedn\u00fd za chorobu COVID-19, \u0161\u00edri po celom svete, m\u00e1 aj v\u00edrusov\u00e9 rady v boji proti pand\u00e9mii.\nJeden \u010dasto kop\u00edrovan\u00fd a prilepen\u00fd k\u00fasok textu, ktor\u00fd sa stal v\u00edrusov\u00fdm na Facebooku, Twitteri a WhatsApp, navrhuje jednoduch\u00fa samokontrolu na koronav\u00edrusov\u00fa infekciu, ktor\u00e1 sa zvy\u010dajne pripisuje \u201eTaiwansk\u00fdm expertom\u201c, \u201eStanfordskej univerzite\u201c alebo \u201eStanfordskej nemocnici\u201c. ostatn\u00e9:\nNov\u00fd koronav\u00edrus nemus\u00ed vykazova\u0165 pr\u00edznaky infekcie po mnoho dn\u00ed.

No other words come to mind.\"\nIn March 2020, as the coronavirus continued to spread around the globe, a viral message circulated on social media that was supposedly written by a doctor in Italy about how the new virus had impacted hospitals in the country.\nSilvia Stringhini, an epidemiologist, shared a translated version of this post on Twitter.\u00a0A screenshot of Stringhini\u2019s first few tweets appear below. The full thread can be viewed here:\n\nStringhini\u2019s viral tweets are a translated version of a real Italian-language Facebook post from\u00a0Dr. Daniele Macchini, an intensive care unit physician at the Humanitas Gavazzeni hospital in Bergamo.\u00a0\nA screenshot of a portion of Macchini\u2019s post appears below. The full post can be viewed here, and a translated version appears in full at the bottom of this article:\n\nMacchini explained that hospitals in Italy were overwhelmed with new cases, urged people to stop downplaying the disease as just a \u201cbad flu,\u201d and asked those who were \u201cunafraid\u201d of the disease to consider how it will impact older populations. Macchini also complimented the cooperative efforts of medical professionals at the hospital, writing that there were \u201cno more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists,\u201d just doctors who \u201csuddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us.\u201d\nHere\u2019s Macchini\u2019s message in full (translated via Google):\nIn one of the constant emails that I receive from my health department on a more than daily basis now these days, there was also a paragraph entitled \u201cdoing social responsibly\u201d, with some recommendations that can only be supported.\nAfter thinking for a long time if and what to write about what is happening to us, I felt that the silence was not at all responsible. I will therefore try to convey to people \u201cnot involved in the work\u201d and further away from our reality, what we are experiencing in Bergamo during these pandemic days from Covid-19.\nI understand the need not to create panic, but when the message of the danger of what is happening does not reach people and I still feel who cares about the recommendations and people who gather together complaining about not being able to go to the gym or to be able to do soccer tournaments I shudder.\nI also understand the economic damage and I am also worried about that. After the epidemic, the tragedy will start again. However, apart from the fact that we are literally also devastating our NHS from an economic point of view, I allow myself to raise the importance of the health damage that is likely throughout the country and I find it nothing short of \u201cchilling\u201d for example that a red zone already requested by the region has not yet been established for the municipalities of Alzano Lombardo and Nembro (I would like to clarify that this is pure personal opinion).\nI myself looked with some amazement at the reorganizations of the entire hospital in the previous week, when our current enemy was still in the shadows: the wards slowly \u201cemptied\u201d, the elective activities interrupted, the intensive therapies freed to create as many beds as possible. Containers arriving in front of the emergency room to create diversified routes and avoid any infections. All this rapid transformation brought into the corridors of the hospital an atmosphere of surreal silence and emptiness that we still did not understand, waiting for a war that was yet to begin and that many (including me) were not so sure would never come with such ferocity .\n(I open a parenthesis: all this in silence and without publicity, while several newspapers had the courage to say that private health care was not doing anything).\nI still remember my night guard a week ago passed unnecessarily without turning a blind eye, waiting for a call from the microbiology of the Sack. I was waiting for the outcome of a swab on the first suspect patient in our hospital, thinking about what consequences it would have for us and the clinic. If I think about it, my agitation for one possible case seems almost ridiculous and unjustified, now that I have seen what is happening.\nWell, the situation is now nothing short of dramatic. No other words come to mind.\nThe war has literally exploded and the battles are uninterrupted day and night.\nOne after the other the unfortunate poor people come to the emergency room. They have far from the complications of a flu. Let\u2019s stop saying it\u2019s a bad flu. In these 2 years I have learned that the people of Bergamo do not come to the emergency room at all. They did well this time too. They followed all the indications given: a week or ten days at home with a fever without going out and risking contagion, but now they can\u2019t take it anymore. They don\u2019t breathe enough, they need oxygen.\nDrug therapies for this virus are few. The course mainly depends on our organism. We can only support it when it can\u2019t take it anymore. It is mainly hoped that our body will eradicate the virus on its own, let\u2019s face it. Antiviral therapies are experimental on this virus and we learn its behavior day after day. Staying at home until the symptoms worsen does not change the prognosis of the disease.\nNow, however, that need for beds in all its drama has arrived. One after another, the departments that had been emptied are filling up at an impressive rate. The display boards with the names of the sick, of different colors depending on the operating unit they belong to, are now all red and instead of the surgical operation there is the diagnosis, which is always the same cursed: bilateral interstitial pneumonia.\nNow, tell me which flu virus causes such a rapid tragedy. Because that\u2019s the difference (now I\u2019m going down a bit in the technical field): in the classical flu, apart from infecting much less population over several months, cases can be complicated less frequently, only when the VIRUS destroying the protective barriers of the Our respiratory tract allows BACTERIA normally resident in the upper tract to invade the bronchi and lungs, causing more serious cases. Covid 19 causes a banal influence in many young people, but in many elderly people (and not only) a real SARS because it arrives directly in the alveoli of the lungs and infects them making them unable to perform their function.\nSorry, but to me as a doctor it doesn\u2019t reassure you that the most serious are mainly elderly people with other pathologies. The elderly population is the most represented in our country and it is difficult to find someone who, above 65 years of age, does not take at least the tablet for pressure or diabetes. I also assure you that when you see young people who end up in intubated intensive care, pronated or worse in ECMO (a machine for the worst cases, which extracts the blood, re-oxygenates it and returns it to the body, waiting for the organism, hopefully, heal your lungs), all this tranquility for your young age passes there.\nAnd while there are still people on social networks who pride themselves on not being afraid by ignoring the indications, protesting that their normal lifestyle habits are \u201ctemporarily\u201d in crisis, the epidemiological disaster is taking place.\nAnd there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists, we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us. The cases multiply, we arrive at the rate of 15-20 hospitalizations a day all for the same reason. The results of the swabs now come one after the other: positive, positive, positive. Suddenly the emergency room is collapsing. Emergency provisions are issued: help is needed in the emergency room. A quick meeting to learn how the first aid management software works and a few minutes later they are already downstairs, next to the warriors on the war front. The PC screen with the reasons for the access is always the same: fever and difficulty breathing, fever and cough, respiratory failure etc \u2026 The exams, radiology always with the same sentence: bilateral interstitial pneumonia, bilateral interstitial pneumonia, bilateral interstitial pneumonia. All to be hospitalized. Someone already to intubate and go to intensive care. For others it is late \u2026\nIntensive care becomes saturated, and where intensive care ends, more are created. Each fan becomes like gold: those of the operating rooms that have now suspended their non-urgent activity become places for intensive care that did not exist before.\nI found it incredible, or at least I can speak for the HUMANITAS Gavazzeni (where I work) how it was possible to implement in such a short time a deployment and a reorganization of resources so finely designed to prepare for a disaster of this magnitude. And every reorganization of beds, wards, staff, work shifts and tasks is constantly reviewed day after day to try to give everything and even more.\nThose wards that previously looked like ghosts are now saturated, ready to try to give their best for the sick, but exhausted. The staff is exhausted. I saw fatigue on faces that didn\u2019t know what it was despite the already grueling workloads they had. I have seen people still stop beyond the times they used to stop already, for overtime that was now habitual. I saw solidarity from all of us, who never failed to go to our internist colleagues to ask \u201cwhat can I do for you now?\u201d or \u201cleave that hospitalization alone.\u201d Doctors who move beds and transfer patients, who administer therapies instead of nurses. Nurses with tears in their eyes because we are unable to save everyone and the vital signs of several patients at the same time reveal an already marked destiny.\nThere are no more shifts, schedules. Social life is suspended for us.\nI have been separated for a few months, and I assure you that I have always done my best to constantly see my son even on the day of disassembly at night, without sleeping and postponing sleep until when I am without him, but for almost 2 weeks I have not voluntarily I see neither my son nor my family members for fear of infecting them and in turn infecting an elderly grandmother or relatives with other health problems. I\u2019m happy with some photos of my son that I regard between tears and a few video calls.\nSo be patient too, you can\u2019t go to the theater, museums or gym. Try to have mercy on that myriad of older people you could exterminate. It is not your fault, I know, but of those who put it in your head that you are exaggerating and even this testimony may seem just an exaggeration for those who are far from the epidemic, but please, listen to us, try to leave the house only to indispensable things. Do not go en masse to make stocks in supermarkets: it is the worst thing because you concentrate and the risk of contacts with infected people who do not know they are. You can go there as you usually do. Maybe if you have a normal mask (even those that are used to do certain manual work) put it on. Don\u2019t look for ffp2 or ffp3. Those should serve us and we are beginning to struggle to find them. By now we have had to optimize their use only in certain circumstances, as the WHO recently suggested in view of their almost ubiquitous impoverishment.\nOh yes, thanks to the shortage of certain devices, I and many other colleagues are certainly exposed despite all the means of protection we have. Some of us have already become infected despite the protocols. Some infected colleagues have in turn infected family members and some of their family members already struggle between life and death.\nWe are where your fears could make you stay away. Try to make sure you stay away. Tell your elderly or other family members to stay indoors. Bring him the groceries please.\nWe have no alternative. It\u2019s our job. In fact, what I do these days is not really the job I\u2019m used to, but I do it anyway and I will like it as long as it responds to the same principles: try to make some sick people feel better and heal, or even just alleviate the suffering and the pain to those who unfortunately cannot heal.\nI don\u2019t spend a lot of words about the people who define us heroes these days and who until yesterday were ready to insult and report us. Both will return to insult and report as soon as everything is over. People forget everything quickly.\nAnd we\u2019re not even heroes these days. It\u2019s our job. We risked something bad every day before: when we put our hands in a belly full of blood of someone we don\u2019t even know if he has HIV or hepatitis C; when we do it even though we know it has HIV or hepatitis C; when we sting with the one with HIV and take the drugs that make us vomit from morning to night for a month. When we open with the usual anguish the results of the tests at the various checks after an accidental puncture hoping not to be infected. We simply earn our living with something that gives us emotions. It doesn\u2019t matter if they are beautiful or ugly, just take them home.\nIn the end we only try to make ourselves useful for everyone. Now try to do it too though: with our actions we influence the life and death of a few dozen people. You with yours, many more.\nPlease share and share the message. We must spread the word to prevent what is happening here in Italy.\nShortly after Macchini\u2019s post went viral, the Italian government announced new restrictions on public travel in an effort to stop the spread of the disease.": "Varoval doktor v Taliansku, \u017ee Coronavirus nebol iba \u201ezlou chr\u00edpkou\u201c?\nLek\u00e1r: \u201eSitu\u00e1cia nie je ni\u010d\u00edm men\u0161\u00edm ne\u017e dramatick\u00e9.\nV marci 2020, ke\u010f sa koronav\u00edrus roz\u0161iroval po celom svete, sa na soci\u00e1lnych m\u00e9di\u00e1ch \u0161\u00edrila v\u00edrusov\u00e1 spr\u00e1va, ktor\u00fa \u00fadajne nap\u00edsal lek\u00e1r v Taliansku o vplyve nov\u00e9ho v\u00edrusu na nemocnice v krajine.\nEpidemiol\u00f3gka Silvia Stringhini zdie\u013ea prelo\u017een\u00fa verziu tohto pr\u00edspevku na Twitteri.

Facebook posts like this are often copied, pasted, and spread across social media where they get attributed to a variety of sources. An unattributed version of this post, for instance, was viewed more than 100,000 times after it was posted to Imgur.\nHiggins does appear to be the true author of this post, however. NBC News contacted her after the post went viral and reported that she is an American currently living in Italy.\u00a0\nNBC News writes:\nFor nearly two weeks, Cristina Higgins, an American who lives in Italy, has traveled no farther from her apartment building than the driveway. Her days begin at the breakfast table with her husband and three children before the kids log online to do their schoolwork from home. The family spends their evenings playing Monopoly in their apartment.\n[\u2026]\n\u201cWe have friends who are getting sick. It\u2019s very stressful,\u201d Higgins told NBC News over the phone from her home in Bergamo, where she, like everyone else, is under government-ordered home isolation, even though she and her family are not sick. \u201cI am nauseous all day long, because every time I look at the news or talk to somebody else, something terrible has happened. And I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next.\u201d\n[\u2026]\nHiggins said she rarely posts to Facebook but felt it was important to convey to those outside of Italy who can\u2019t comprehend how bad the situation is that they need to do whatever they can to not pass on the disease.\nHiggins appears to be the true author of this post. Furthermore, the claims she made in the post, generally speaking, are accurate. Let\u2019s examine a few of her assertions.\nIs COVID-19 the Same as the Flu?\u00a0\nWhile COVID-19 has been compared to the flu and has similar symptoms, Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the House Oversight and Reform Committee that COVID-19 was at least \u201c10 times as lethal\u201d as the seasonal flu.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s a clip of Fauci\u2019s testimony:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe transcribed the relevant portion below:\nFor the practical understanding of the American people, the seasonal flu that we deal with every year has a mortality of 0.1%. The stated mortality overall of this [coronavirus], when you look at all the data including China, is about 3% [\u2026]. If you count all the cases of minimal symptomatic or asymptomatic infection, that probably brings the mortality rate down to 1%. Which means that it is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu.\nIs Italy Under Lockdown?\nIn general, yes. Italy has restricted public gatherings and travel for all 60 million of its residents. Nonessential businesses such as restaurants and bars have been closed, and the country is encouraging social distancing. Food stores and pharmacies are about the only businesses that will be allowed to stay open until restrictions are lifted.\u00a0\nCNN reported:\nItaly has imposed sweeping nationwide restrictions on travel and public life, a desperate attempt to contain the coronavirus outbreak that looks set to plunge the world\u2019s eighth largest economy into a steep recession.\nThe measures announced late Monday include travel restrictions on 60 million residents, a ban on public events, the closure of schools, movie theaters, museums and gyms, and limits on opening hours for restaurants, bars and shops.\nThe government took action as the number of deaths caused by coronavirus reached 463 and infections topped 9,000, more than double the number reported in China as a share of the population. The restrictions are in place until at least April 3.\nAre Intensive Care Units in Italy Operating at Capacity?\u00a0\nOne major concern about a viral outbreak is that there won\u2019t be enough beds and supplies to treat sick people. Although Italy may have adequate space to treat people during a normal year, hospitals can become overwhelmed when there is a surge of patients. That is currently the case in Italy.\u00a0\nVox reports:\nThe coronavirus has overwhelmed the country\u2019s health system, particularly in the north. More than 80 percent of the hospital beds in\u00a0Lombardy, the hardest-hit province, are being occupied by coronavirus patients, according to\u00a0Bloomberg.\u00a0Intensive care units\u00a0are overloaded while\u00a0elective surgeries\u00a0have been canceled in the process to free up beds. Stories abound on\u00a0social media\u00a0about doctors struggling to meet their patients\u2019 needs, even\u00a0rationing care.\nCan Young People Get the Coronavirus?\nAlthough older generations are certainly at higher risk of dying from this disease, young people are not immune to COVID-19. The CDC writes that \u201cinfections in children have been reported, including in very young children.\u201d While many younger people may have a strong enough immune system to survive the disease, they can catch it, carry it, and spread it to more people.\u00a0\nThe Verge writes:\nMost people who are young or healthy and who contract the virus don\u2019t get severely ill. But if you have the virus, even if you don\u2019t get that sick, you might come into contact with people who are more at risk \u2014 and pass the virus to them. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to stay home if you\u2019re not feeling well. Minimizing the number of people each sick person infects is low-tech, but it\u2019s the best way to slow the spread of a disease like COVID-19. It\u2019s the goal of policies like school closures and event cancellations and why people who might have been exposed to the illness are asked to isolate themselves.\nThe Facebook Post\u00a0\nFor reference, here is the full text of Higgins\u2019s Facebook post:\nI am writing to you from Bergamo, Italy, at the heart of the coronavirus crisis. The news media in the US has not captured the severity of what is happening here. I am writing this post because each of you, today, not the government, not the school district, not the mayor, each individual citizen has the chance, today to take actions that will deter the Italian situation from becoming your own country\u2019s reality. The only way to stop this virus is to limit contagion. And the only way to limit contagion is for millions of people to change their behavior today.\nIf you are in Europe or the US you are weeks away from where we are today in Italy.\nI can hear you now. \u201cIt\u2019s just a flu. It only affects old people with preconditions\u201d\nThere are 2 reasons why Coronavirus has brought Italy to it\u2019s knees. First it is a flu is devastating when people get really sick they need weeks of ICU \u2013 and, second, because of how fast and effectively it spreads. There is 2 week incubation period and many who have it never show symptoms.\nWhen Prime Minister Conte announced last night that the entire country, 60 million people, would go on lock down, the line that struck me most was \u201cthere is no more time.\u201d Because to be clear, this national lock down, is a hail mary. What he means is that if the numbers of contagion do not start to go down, the system, Italy, will collapse.\nWhy? Today the ICUs in Lombardy are at capacity \u2013 more than capacity. They have begun to put ICU units in the hallways. If the numbers do not go down, the growth rate of contagion tells us that there will be thousands of people who in a matter of a week? two weeks? who will need care. What will happen when there are 100, or a 1000 people who need the hospital and only a few ICU places left?\nOn Monday a doctor wrote in the paper that they have begun to have to decide who lives and who dies when the patients show up in the emergency room, like what is done in war. This will only get worse.\nThere are a finite number of drs, nurses, medical staff and they are getting the virus. They have also been working non-stop, non-stop for days and days. What happens when the drs, nurses and medical staff are simply not able to care for the patients, when they are not there?\nAnd finally for those who say that this is just something that happens to old people, starting yesterday the hospitals are reporting that younger and younger patients \u2013 40, 45, 18, are coming in for treatment.\nYou have a chance to make a difference and stop the spread in your country. Push for the entire office to work at home today, cancel birthday parties, and other gatherings, stay home as much as you can. If you have a fever, any fever, stay home. Push for school closures, now. Anything you can do to stop the spread, because it is spreading in your communities \u2013 there is a two week incubation period \u2013 and if you do these things now you can buy your medical system time.\nAnd for those who say it is not possible to close the schools, and do all these other things, locking down Italy was beyond anyone\u2019s imagination a week ago.\nSoon you will not have a choice, so do what you can now.\nPlease share.": "", "To test for the new coronavirus, take a deep breath and hold for more than 10 seconds.

Tell us about any questionable, confusing, or concerning rumors and \u201cadvice\u201d you encounter. \n\nIn early March 2020, as the availability and cost of testing members of the public for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease sweeping the globe was a hot issue, a widely-shared tweet offered a supposed \u201cloophole\u201d for obtaining such testing for free.

We remind you that the treatment of a poorly tolerated fever or pain in the context of COVID19 or any other respiratory virosis is based on paracetamol, without exceeding the dose of 60 mg/kg/day and 3g/day. NSAIDs should be banned.\n\nCOVID-19 \u2014 Taking anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, cortisone, \u2026) could be a factor in worsening the infection. If you have a fever, take paracetamol [also known as acetaminophen]. If you are already on anti-inflammatory drugs or in doubt, ask your doctor for advice.\nDr. Amir Khan, a National Health Service (NHS) doctor and a senior university lecturer in the U.K., offered the following explanation about why taking anti-inflammatory drugs might have a deleterious effect on persons dealing with a COVID-19 infection:\nDespite all of their beneficial effects, it has long been known that anti-inflammatories can have a depressive effect on parts of our immune systems.\nWhen it comes to taking them to help ease the symptoms of the common cold, we do not really have to worry about this slight but important reduction in the strength of our immune systems: We are very unlikely to develop complications from the common cold, let alone die from it.\nBut we need our immune system in top working order in order to battle the coronavirus and win.\nWhen the virus enters the human body, it induces mild to severe respiratory problems, a high fever, cough and, potentially, multi-organ dysfunction, which can lead to death.\nAn early part of our body\u2019s immune response to a virus of this sort is to release cells called mast cells, which form our first line of defense against the virus.\nThese [mast cells] are released very quickly from our respiratory tract \u2014 the nasal passageway and linings of the lungs.\nWhen the mast cells come into contact with the virus, they then trigger a much bigger immune response, which involves inflammatory chemicals being released.\nWe need these inflammatory chemicals to help tackle the virus in the medium to long term. It is the effectiveness of these chemicals that decides whether a person develops complications from the coronavirus or makes a full recovery.\nIf we take medicines that dampen this immune response, such as ibuprofen, this can lead to us not fighting off the infection as effectively, potentially leading to a longer illness with a higher risk of complications.\nThese warnings to avoid ibuprofen (commonly known by the brand name Advil) generated mixed reactions among the medical community, with some asserting that scientific evidence to support it was lacking, and others maintaining that it was generally good advice:\n\u201cDeeply concerned about this bold statement,\u201d Muge Cevik, a researcher at the University of St Andrews Infection and Global Health Division, said on Twitter. \u201cThere\u2019s no scientific evidence I am aware of that ibuprofen [causes worse] outcomes in #COVID19.\u201d\nBut other experts suggested that V\u00e9ran\u2019s advice is in line with some countries\u2019 general guidance on anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen, even if their specific connection to the coronavirus is not clear.\n\u201cThere is a good reason to avoid ibuprofen as it may exacerbate acute kidney injury brought on by any severe illness, including severe COVID-19 disease. There isn\u2019t yet any widely accepted additional reason to avoid it for COVID-19,\u201d Rupert Beale, a group leader in Cell Biology of Infection at the UK\u2019s Francis Crick Institute, told the UK\u2019s Science Media Centre.\nExemplifying that split of opinion, Dr. Tom Wingfield, senior clinical lecturer and honorary consultant physician at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, observed that it was unclear whether the proffered advice about ibuprofen was specific to COVID-19 or merely ordinary \u201cgood practice,\u201d but that in any case paracetamol \u201cwould generally be preferred over ibuprofen to relieve symptoms caused by infection such as fever\u201d:\nIn the UK, paracetamol would generally be preferred over non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (\u201cNSAIDS\u201d) such as ibuprofen to relieve symptoms caused by infection such as fever. This is because, when taken according to the manufacturer\u2019s and/or a health professional\u2019s instructions in terms of timing and maximum dosage, it is less likely to cause side effects. Side effects associated with NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, especially if taken regularly for a prolonged period, are stomach irritation and stress on the kidneys, which can be more severe in people who already have stomach or kidney issues. It is not clear from the French Minister\u2019s comments whether the advice given is generic \u2018good practice\u2019 guidance or specifically related to data emerging from cases of Covid-19 but this might become clear in due course. It should also be noted that, in the UK, we would not commonly use cortisone to relieve infection-related symptoms such as fever.\nAs Khan cautioned, for now patients and their doctors will need to be aware of the \u201ccareful balance between managing the symptoms of their long-term health condition and risking the devastating effects of the coronavirus.\u201d He advised that paracetamol or acetaminophen may be preferable alternative medications for pain and fever associated with COVID-19.": "", "unproven": "", "Gargling with salt water or Vinegar 'eliminate' the COVID-19 coronavirus from the throat of an infected person's system.": "", "Will Gargling with Salt Water or Vinegar \u2018Eliminate\u2019 the COVID-19 Coronavirus?\nWhat works for colds is unlikely to help an already-infected person stave off the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic of early 2020 brought a raft of dubious and false medical advice about the prevention and treatment of the illness to the internet, among which was one widely circulated graphic advocating that persons exposed to the virus try gargling various substance to \u2018eliminate\u2019 the virus and prevent it from reaching the lungs via the throat: \n\u201cCorona virus before it reaches the lungs it remains in the throat for four days and at this time the person begins to cough and have throat pains. If he drinks water a lot and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus. Spread this information because you can save someone with this information.\u201d\n\nWhile gargling some combination of warm water, salt, and vinegar has long been used as a means of relieving symptoms related to colds and flus, such as sore throats, there\u2019s no evidence that it can help ward off or drive out infections from the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.  And although the virus is said to replicate in the nose and nasal secretions, we\u2019ve found nothing documenting the notion that the current coronavirus \u201cremains in the throat for four days\u201d and can be effectively expelled at the conclusion of that time period to keep it from reaching the lungs.  (The incubation period for this virus, which is the time between when a person is exposed to the virus and when they start showing symptoms, has been estimated at about five days on average.)\nThe World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) website offers a page offering COVID-19 coronavirus disease advice for the public which addresses the substance of this rumor in an item about rinsing nasal passages (which are connected to the throat) with saline:\n\nThere is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus. \nThere is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrinking sufficient water to stay adequately hydrated is generally good health advice at any time, but gargling with it (whether in plain form or as saline/vinegar) is of doubtful benefit for \u2018eliminating\u2019 the coronavirus once it has already taken": "", "Are governments doing enough to limit the coronavirus pandemic?": "", "Are children more at risk to coronavirus?": "", "Before a vaccine, can coronavirus be treated?": "", "People who have survived the COVID-19 coronavirus disease can become reinfected by the virus.": "", "Can People Who Recover from COVID-19 Become Reinfected?\nMedical professionals believe positive coronavirus retests are more likely the result of errors in testing rather than reinfection.\nAs the world grappled with the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic in early 2020, people around the globe began to consider the dread possibility that COVID-19 might not only be more infectious and have a much higher mortality rate than the seasonal flu, but that at least some persons who survived  it might become reinfected rather than developing an immunity to it.  \nA few reports have trickled in from around the world suggesting that someone who had COVID-19 recovered and then fell ill with it again, such as the following account from China:\n\nMr. Wang, a resident of Xuzhou, in Jiangsu province, appeared to have emerged victorious from a monthlong battle with the illness. \nThree days later, though, Wang tested positive for the coronavirus again. He was re-hospitalized and his neighbors were locked down once more. His current condition is unknown.\nWang, whose full name has not been disclosed for privacy reasons, is one of more than 100 reported cases of Chinese patients who have been released from hospitals as survivors of the new coronavirus \u2014 only to test positive for it a second time in the bewildering math of this mysterious illness.\n\nHowever, at this juncture it\u2019s difficult to determine whether such reports document that fully recovered COVID-19 patients truly became infected anew, or whether those persons may have relapsed or not completely recovered from their first bout of the illness.  Problems with diagnostic testing techniques have been raised as one possibility to explain why some patients might have retested positive for COVID-19 after seemingly recovering:\n\n[Such cases] are raising questions in China about the reliability of diagnostic tests, the possibility of reinfection and whether patients are wrongly designated as \u201crecovered\u201d and released too early from hospitals.\nScientists in and outside China agree that reinfection is a highly unlikely explanation for the patients who retest positive. They say testing errors are more likely to blame \u2014 either false negatives that resulted in patients being discharged too early, or false positives when they retested and were taken back into hospital.\nThose errors could be attributed to contaminated test samples, human error while taking swabs, or an oversensitive nucleic acid test that detects strands of virus.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times quoted Dr. Keiji Fukuda, director of Hong Kong University\u2019s School of Public Health, as saying that COVID-19 reinfection was unlikely and that false positives in testing procedures were a more likely possibility:\n\n\u201cIf you get an infection, your immune system is revved up against that virus,\u201d he said. \u201cTo get reinfected again when you\u2019re in that situation would be quite unusual unless your immune system was not functioning right.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more likely is that people are being released from hospitals while still carrying dormant fragments of the disease that are not infectious but resemble the virus when put through a nucleic acid test, he said.\n\u201cThe test may be positive, but the infection is not there,\u201d he said\n\nDr. Clifford Lane, deputy director for Clinical Research and Special Projects at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was also quoted as suggesting that the real issue was with inaccuracies in testing patients who had not fully recovered rather than with reinfection:\n\nAnother possibility is that the level of virus fell below the threshold that tests could detect but then resurfaced, [Lane] said.\n\u201cSo it looks like [some patients] cleared the virus and then the virus came back,\u201d Lane said. \u201cBut they never really cleared it and they had a more prolonged course of infection.\u201d\nLane was one of only two U.S. experts in a World Health Organization delegation that visited China in February. He said Chinese experts told the visitors that there were no examples of people who became \u201creinfected.\u201d\n\nA coronavirus infection\u2019s going into a \u201cdormant\u201d stage and then re-emerging was another possibility for explaining the appearance of reinfection suggested by Dr. Philip M. Tierno, Clinical Professor of Microbiology and Pathology at at New York University: \u201cOnce you have the infection, it could remain dormant with minimal symptoms.  And then you can get an exacerbation if it finds its way into the lungs.\u201d \nThe Associated Press also offered the possibility that mutations in the virus might conceivably make it different enough to reinfect persons who had acquired immunity to an earlier version:\n\nScientists at the at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle say the 30,000-letter genetic code of the virus changes by one letter every 15 days. It\u2019s not known how many of these changes would be needed for the virus to seem different enough to the immune system of someone who had a previous version of it for it to cause a fresh infection.\n\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who is for many Americans the most familiar source for information on the coronavirus disease (due to his numerous appearances at government press conferences and cable television news reports), told Congress that he felt it was unlikely anyone could become reinfected by the virus: \u201cWe haven\u2019t formally proved it, but \u2026 if this acts like any other virus, once you recover, you won\u2019t get reinfected.\u201d   \nWhile this topic is an area that requires additional study, medical professionals still caution that \u201cThe things to worry about are at the other end of the illness\u201d \u2014 that the primary focus should still be on limiting the outbreak by trying to ensure that symptomatic and undiagnosed persons are not exposing themselves to, and potentially infecting, others.": "", "Does soap work on coronavirus?": "", "Will people get Coronavirus pandemic fatigue?": "", "Does the transmission of coronavirus vary by country?": "", "Italy has stopped treating elderly coronavirus patients due to \"socialized medicine.\"": "", "Has Italy Stopped Treating the Elderly in the COVID-19 Pandemic?\nA viral social media post claimed Italian doctors were not treating older patients with coronavirus due to \"socialized medicine.\"\nAs governments fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Snopes is fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation, and you can help.

A social media meme exacerbated the anxiety with the claim that Italian doctors had \u201cdecided NOT to treat the elderly,\u201d and that that was the result of \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d\nAs of mid-March, Italy was the hardest-hit nation outside of Asia and had become the new epicenter for the global pandemic. As in China, where the virus was initially detected in the winter of 2019, the Italian health care system was overwhelmed by the disease. Amid fears that the United States could end up in a similar situation, a viral Facebook meme pointed the finger at Italy\u2019s government-run health care system.The meme appears to represent both an exaggeration and distortion of news reports and events in Italy regarding the coronavirus. Readers also inquired about an article published by the British news publication The Telegraph, headlined, \u201cItalians over 80 \u2018will be left to die\u2019 as country overwhelmed by coronavirus.\u201d The article references a document drawn up by health officials in Turin, a city in Northern Italy hit hard by the virus, with guidelines for if and when \u201cIt becomes impossible to provide all patients with intensive care service.\u201d In such a case, the document says, \u201cIt will be necessary to apply criteria for access to intensive treatment, which depends on the limited resources available.\u201d\nThe Telegraph reported that the document \u201cproduced by the civil protection department of the Piedmont region, one of those hardest hit, says: \u2018The criteria for access to intensive therapy in cases of emergency must include age of less than 80 or a score on the Charlson comorbidity Index [which indicates how many other medical conditions the patient has] of less than 5.'\u201d\nThe guidelines were expected to affect the whole country and go into effect, according to the Telegraph, \u201c\u2018If the situation becomes of such an exceptional nature as to make the therapeutic choices on the individual case dependent on the availability of resources, forcing [hospitals] to focus on those cases in which the cost/benefit ratio is more favorable for clinical treatment.'\u201d\nIn other words, it is not true that Italy as a whole had \u201cdecided not to treat their elderly\u201d for the coronavirus. What is true per news reports is that overwhelmed Italian health systems that have more patients than available equipment could face \u201ccatastrophe\u201d triage decisions not seen since World War II. That has nothing to do the fact that Italy, like other European countries, has a public health care system, or what some people call \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d It is instead the result of the sheer volume of cases flooding the hospitals.\nAs of March 12, 2020, The New York Times reported that Italian officials had maintained that everyone who needed care was entitled to it. In a public statement on the matter, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte stated, \u201cWe live in a system in which we guarantee health and the right of everyone to be cured. It\u2019s a foundation, a pillar, and I\u2019d say a characteristic of our system of civilization. And thus we can\u2019t allow ourselves to let our guard down.\u201d\nThe Times also reported that Flavia Petrini, president of the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care, had issued \u201ccatastrophe medicine\u201d guidelines:\n\u201cIn a context of grave shortage of health resources,\u201d the guidelines say, intensive care should be given to \u201cpatients with the best chance of success\u201d and those with the \u201cbest hope of life\u201d should be prioritized.\nThe guidelines also say that in \u201cin the interests of maximizing benefits for the largest number,\u201d limits could be put on intensive care units to reserve scarce resources to those who have, first, \u201cgreater likelihood of survival and secondly who have more potential years of life.\u201d\n\u201cNo one is getting kicked out, but we\u2019re offering criteria of priority,\u201d Dr. Petrini said. \u201cThese choices are made in normal times, but what\u2019s not normal is when you have to assist 600 people all at once.\u201d\nGiulio Gallera, the Lombardy official leading the emergency response, said on Thursday that he hoped the guidelines never needed to be applied.\nIn sum, Italy did not announce it would abandon elderly patients with COVID-19 wholesale. Instead, health care workers in various circumstances and locales might be forced to ration treatment and make judgments based on who is expected to live longest, if treated. Chinese doctors have faced this situation, and some fear it may be in store for the U.S. health care system if the number of active coronavirus cases in the United States isn\u2019t successfully controlled. We therefore rate this claim a \u201cMixture\u201d of true and false.": "", "Jared Kushner\u2019s brother, Joshua Kushner, owns a company involved in COVID-19 testing.": "", "Does Jared Kushner\u2019s Brother Own a Company Involved in COVID-19 Testing?\nOscar, a digital health-insurance startup that recently set up a service for users to find COVID-19 testing centers, was co-founded by Joshua Kushner.\nAs governments fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Snopes is fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation, and you can help. Tell us about any questionable, confusing, or concerning rumors and \u201cadvice\u201d you encounter. \n\nCompared to the output of most other developed countries, the United States\u2019 ability to test for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, has been extremely limited. This reality has led to rumors that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, or some of its members, have a financial interest in promoting specific tests as opposed to others that would be more widely available or more easily distributed.\nOne claim that has emerged in this vein came from a report by Raw Story that asserted \u201cthe Kushner family is trying to cash in on the pandemic that could kill millions of us.\u201d The basis for this claim concerns the health insurance startup Oscar co-founded by Jared Kushner\u2019s brother, Joshua Kushner. Jared Kushner is the son-in-law of and special adviser to Trump.\nOscar Health\u2019s COVID-19 Testing Locator\nOn March 13, 2020, Oscar announced that it would be launching a testing-center locator for COVID-19:\nToday, Oscar, a tech-driven health insurance company, launched the first testing center locator for COVID-19 in the U.S., featuring more than 100 centers today. It is accessible to the general public and more testing centers are being added every day.\nHowever, the details of Oscar\u2019s testing locator have been described incorrectly in several viral social media posts alleging profiteering from the Kushners during the coronavirus pandemic. A well-shared post by a user named \u201cBoston Judy,\u201d for example, asserted that \u201cwe didn\u2019t have testing because the Trump family circle wanted to wait till they could make a profit.\u201d\n\nEven if this assertion had merit, the actions Oscar took merely help locate unaffiliated testing centers. As an insurance company, Oscar does not manufacture, perform, analyze, or sell any actual COVID-19 test. Further, the test-center locator that Oscar developed is open to the general public and is not limited to people who get insurance through Oscar. Once a user has taken a short survey, the locator will provide the closest locations for testing in areas in which they operate. While the service also acts as a promotion for the company, it can serve as a testing center locator for any interested party.\nWill Oscar Health Profit from COVID-19?\n\u201cBoston Judy\u201d later clarified that Oscar was not producing tests, but that the company would get to \u201cbill the feds for evaluating people for COVID and referring them to a testing center if they meet the criteria [for testing].\u201d While the legislation that would allow for such a reimbursement likely will include a fund for covering the cost of these tests, the legislation has not yet been finalized, and it\u2019s unclear that it would really be a windfall for Oscar, either.\nOn March 13, 2020, U.S. House Democrats and the White House reached a deal on a package of legislation that included a requirement that insurance companies cover the full cost of COVID-19 with no cost sharing. As described by the Brookings Institute, this legislation, if and when it is passed by the Senate and signed by the president:\nWould offer financial support to state governments by temporarily increasing the share of Medicaid spending financed by the federal government, require almost all forms of health insurance to cover COVID-19 testing without cost-sharing, and create mechanisms to pay for COVID-19 testing for uninsured people.\nIn other words, while the government will likely be subsidizing insurance companies like Oscar, they are doing so to cover losses incurred by the requirement for full reimbursement to members. These laws, and the federal reimbursement they would authorize, would apply to any health insurance company in America, not only Oscar.\nDoes Jared Kushner Have Anything to Do With Oscar?\nJoshua Kushner co-founded Oscar in 2012. His venture capital firm, Thrive Capital, holds a significant ownership share. According to financial-disclosure forms released by Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, covering the year 2018, the couple owned and received profit from shares of Thrive:\n\nThis document also appears to assert that the couple divested from Thrive during the 2018 financial year:\n\nJared Kushner recently divested from another of his brother\u2019s enterprises: the \u201creal estate crowdfunding platform\u201d Cadre. In that instance, the Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) obtained a certificate of divestiture documenting Jared Kushner\u2019s involvement in that company. Thus far, however, no certificate of divestiture has been produced publicly that documents Jared Kushner\u2019s divestment in the company that owns Oscar.\nThat being said, the assertion that the Kushners as a family are involved in the business of COVID-19 testing is not entirely accurate. The company\u2019s coronavirus response so far is limited to an online form that allows users to find a testing location if their symptoms call for it. Health insurance companies are likely to be reimbursed for covering the cost of COVID-19 testing once legislation is passed, but this would apply to all insurance providers, not just Oscar.

The country of 50 million appears to have greatly slowed its epidemic; it reported only 74 new cases today, down from 909 at its peak on 29 February. And it has done so without locking down entire cities or taking some of the other authoritarian measures that helped China bring its epidemic under control.\u201d\nOne reason for South Korea\u2019s success, according to CNN, is that the COVID-19 outbreak occurred in a population of relatively young, non-smoking women.\u00a0\nItaly is hit hard, experts say, only because they have the oldest population in Europe.\nWhile South Korea may have benefited from this disease impacting its young population first, Italy, on the other hand, has one of the oldest populations on earth.\u00a0\nWired reported: \u201cItaly has been hit particularly hard, with some 2,000 deaths thus far. Overwhelmed hospital staffers have had to make devastating decisions about who to treat and who they must let perish. The reason why Italy is suffering so badly, write University of Oxford researchers in a new paper in the journal Demographic Science, may be twofold: The country has the second-oldest population on earth, and its young tend to mingle more often with the elderly, like their grandparents. Such demographic research will be critical in facing down the threat elsewhere, as more countries grapple with a deadly pandemic that\u2019s just getting started and we learn more about how the virus is transmitted within families and communities.\u201d\nScientists in Israel likely to announce the development of a coronavirus vaccine.\nHaaertz reported on March 18 that \u201cscientists at Israel\u2019s Institute for Biological Research\u201d have made a \u201csignificant breakthrough,\u201d and that they could announce in the next few days that they have completed development of a vaccine.\u00a0\nHaaertz said: \u201cAccording to medical sources, the scientists have recently had a significant breakthrough in understanding the biological mechanism and qualities of the virus, including better diagnostic capability, production of antibodies for those who already have the virus and development of a vaccine.\u201d\nHowever, it will still be awhile before this vaccine reaches a larger population.\u00a0\nHaaertz added: \u201cThe development process requires a series of tests and experiments that may last many months before the vaccination is deemed effective or safe to use.\u201d\n3 Maryland coronavirus patients fully recovered; able to return to everyday life.\nFox 5 DC reported on March 14 that Maryland\u2019s first three coronavirus patients had all recovered and were returning to their homes.\u00a0\nThe news outlet wrote: \u201cOn Friday, Montgomery County\u2019s Chief Health Officer Dr. Travis Gayles told FOX 5 the first three people to test positive for Coronavirus in the state of Maryland have recovered and are able to resume their normal lives.\u201d\nA network of Canadian scientists are making excellent progress in Covid-19 research.\nThe Montreal Gazette reported on March 13 that the country\u2019s scientists were making progress on COVID-19 research as they were able to isolate a copy of the coronavirus.\u00a0\n\u201cA team of Canadian researchers from Ontario has isolated and grown copies of the coronavirus, the agent responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19 that has spread worldwide,\u201d the Gazette said. \u201cThe isolated virus will help researchers in Canada and across the world develop better diagnostic testing, treatments and vaccines, and to gain a fuller understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\u201d\nA San Diego biotech company is developing a Covid-19 vaccine in collaboration with Duke University and National University of Singapore.\nA CBS TV station reported on March 12 that the San Diego biotech company Arcturus Therapeutics was working on a COVID-19 vaccine.\u00a0\nThe outlet reported: \u201cAs the race to develop a vaccine for coronavirus / COVID-19 continues globally, the San Diego based biotech company, Arcturus Therapeutics, is working on creating one at its Torrey Pines lab \u2026 The biotech company is working with Duke NUS- Medical School, a partnership between Duke University and the National University of Singapore.\u201d\nTulsa County\u2019s first positive COVID-19 case has recovered. This individual has had two negative tests, which is the indicator of recovery.\nTulsa World reported on March 12 that the county\u2019s first coronavirus case had fully recovered. The Tulsa Health Department reported the good news on Facebook:\n\nAll 7 patients who were getting treated for at Safdarjung hospital in New Delhi have recovered.\nThe Hindu reported on March 14 that seven coronavirus patients at Safdarjung hospital in New Delhi had recovered from the disease, writing: \u201cSafdarjung Hospital, which is treating a bulk of COVID-19 patients here in the Capital has reported that seven of the positive cases currently admitted in the hospital have recovered but are yet to be discharged.\u201d\u00a0\nPlasma from newly recovered patients from Covid-19 can treat others infected by Covid-19.\nThe final item on this list refers to an experimental treatment. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Stephen Hahn said that the FDA was experimenting with a new COVID-19 treatment involving the plasma from a person who recovered from the disease:\nTech Crunch reported:\nHahn also highlighted another experimental treatment possibility that the FDA is investigating: Using plasma derived from blood taken from coronavirus patients who have recovered, and injecting that into other patients in an attempt to potentially jump start their own immune response.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cross-agency effort about something called convalescent plasma,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a pretty exciting area. And again, this is something that we have given assistance to other countries with as this crisis has developed, so FDA has been working for some time on this. If you\u2019ve been exposed to coronavirus and you\u2019re better, you don\u2019t have the virus in your blood. We could collect the blood now, this is a possible treatment. This is not a proven treatment, I just want to emphasize that, [but we would] collect the blood, concentrate that and have the ability, once it\u2019s pathogen-free, that is virus-free, be able to give that to other patients and the immunoglobulins, the immune response could potentially provide a benefit to patients.\u201d\nIn Summary\nThe claims on the popular \u201cgood news\u201d list are generally accurate and supported by credible news reports. The number of new cases in China and South Korea have dropped since the pandemic began, enough so that China has closed its temporary hospitals.

The researchers compared the distribution of blood types in the infected patients to the distribution of blood types of uninfected people (as a control group) from Wuhan City and Shenzhen City.\nThe team analyzed the data in an effort to answer two questions. First, if infection from COVID-19 appeared disproportionately high or low in any blood group; and second, if instances of death from COVID-19 had any relationship to blood type. The researchers found that:\n\nPeople with blood Type-A blood were more susceptible to both infection and death from COVID-19.\nPeople with blood Type-O were less susceptible to both infection and death from COVID-19.\n\nThese results, which the authors cautioned should not be used to guide clinical practice, came with several caveats. First, this study is a draft of a research paper that has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in any journal. Second, the study is limited in both sample size and geographic scope. Speaking to the South China Morning Post, Gao Yingdai, a Tianjin-based researcher not involved in the study, said that while a 2,000-person sample is not necessarily small, it is dwarfed by the number of cases globally.\u00a0\nTara Moriarty, an expert in infectious diseases and immunopathology with the University of Toronto, told us by email that the study provides \u201can interesting observation that may have an impact on how we identify those most at risk of disease, but until it has been fully peer-reviewed and confirmed/disconfirmed by additional studies, we cannot yet say if blood type affects susceptibility to COVID-19 infection.\u201d\nGao, the Tianjin-based researcher, echoed this point with the Morning Post, saying the results \u201cmay be helpful to medical professionals, but ordinary citizens should not take the statistics too seriously\u201d and that \u201cIf you are type A, there is no need to panic.\u201d\nABO blood type is determined by the presence or absence of specific proteins or sugars known as antibodies found in the plasma component of blood, as well as the presence or absence of proteins or sugars known as antigens found on the surface of red blood cells. Several viral infections, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), appear to have a certain affinity for specific blood types. \u201cBlood type groups are associated with differences in vulnerability to infection with multiple viruses, and severity of outcomes, Moriarity told us. \u201cExamples include HIV, viruses that cause gastrointestinal illness (norovirus, rotavirus), as well as the SARS coronavirus that caused the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak.\u201d\nThe exact mechanism behind difference in how viruses respond to blood types is not well-understood, but may involve how antigens and antibodies inhibit or promote a virus binding to the surface of a cell, Moriarity said.\nIn short, ample scientific evidence exists for the hypothesis that COVID-19 \u2014 or other infections \u2014 could affect people differently depending on their blood type. However, such a conclusion cannot be made confidently on the basis of a single study that has yet to be peer reviewed or published in a journal. As such, we rank this claim about blood types as \u201cUnproven.\u201d": "", "Can humans get coronavirus from dogs?": "", "Eating bananas is a preventative against the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.": "", "Will Eating Bananas Prevent Coronavirus Infection?\nBananas are a good source of various nutrients, but eating them doesn't offer solid protection against COVID-19.\nAmidst the plethora of misleading preventatives and cures for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease offered online during the pandemic of early 2020 was a video posted to Facebook which suggested that consuming bananas could ward off infection by the novel coronavirus:\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the video did not stem from any reputable news agency, nor did it offer anything documenting that the consumption of bananas was an effective preventative against COVID-19.  It misleadingly combined clips from a January 2020 ABC Australia news segment and a February 2020 Wall Street Journal news video about efforts by scientists at the University of Queensland and the National Institutes of Health to develop a coronavirus vaccine, interspersed with added inserts and overlays about bananas that touted the supposed health benefits of the fruit, as follows:\n\nBananas are one of the most popular fruits worldwide.  such as Vitamin C. All of these support health.  people who follow a high fiber diet have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.  Bananas contain water and fiver, both of which promote regularity and encourage digestive health.  Research made by scientists and the University of Queensland in Australia have proven that bananas improve your immune system due to the super source of Vitamins B-6 and helps prevent coronavirus.  Having a banana a day keeps the coronavirus away.\n\nIt is true that bananas, consumed in moderation, are fairly good sources of fiber, dietary potassium, vitamin B6, and vitamin C, all of which are important components of a healthy diet.\nHowever, other than contributing in a modest way to general good health, the consumption of bananas does not specifically do anything to \u201cprevent coronavirus,\u201d nor have scientists at the University of Queensland asserted any such claim.\nThe most effective methods to protect yourself against contracting COVID-19 do not involve eating any specific food, but rather maintaining a safe distance from others who might spread the virus to you and regularly following basic sanitary/hygienic procedures:\n\no Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub\no Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell\no Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell\no Don\u2019t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean": "", "Is COVID-19 more dangerous the seasonal flu?": "", "The COVID-19 coronavirus disease is \"spreading quickly from gas pumps.\"": "", "Is COVID-19 Being Spread Through Gas Pumps?\nGas pump handles are one of many common objects that could be contaminated, so consumers should take reasonable precautions to avoid exposure.\nIn March 2020, during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic, social media users began sharing warnings about the virus\u2019 allegedly \u201cspreading quickly from gas pumps.\u201d  Such warnings cautioned readers to use gloves or paper towels while pumping gas and to discard them immediately afterward:\n\nOne particular version of this class of warning attributed the advice to \u201cGalway Hospital\u201d in Ireland:\n\nHowever, University Hospital Galway told TheJournal.ie that \u201cwe\u2019ve not issued any such advice.\u201d\nAs for the content of the message (regardless of its source), as with many coronavirus-related pieces of advice, it\u2019s something of a mixed bag.\nWe\u2019re not aware of any credible reports of COVID-19 being spread via gas pump handles (something that would likely be difficult to determine as the specific source of any particular infection).  It is true that surface contact is one of the means of transmission of the novel coronavirus, and since gas pumps are objects that are typically handled by many different people throughout the course of a day \u2014 in many places without being regularly cleaned between uses (especially in areas where self-service is the norm) \u2014 they are a potential route for the virus to spread from person to person. \nHow much risk pumping gas poses relative to other ordinary day-to-day activities is difficult to determine.  Consumer Reports, for example, offered advice consistent with what was expressed in social media warnings:\n\nFor many [persons] the occasional trip to the gas station is inevitable, as is touching the pump handle and payment keypad. Pump handles and credit card keypads, which are high-touch areas, could have the virus present, which experts say can stay alive for hours or even days on hard surfaces \u2026\n[T]here are a few things you can do that will help you stay safe when you have to pump gas.\n\u2022 Consider carrying some disposable nitrile or latex gloves in your car to use when gripping the pump handle. Short of that, you can try to use paper towels that are sometimes available at the pump or have some with you to cover your hands when you grip the handle. \n\u2022 Invert the gloves and throw them away, and also any paper towels you might have used. Use hand sanitizer to make sure your hands are clean after you\u2019re done and before you get back into your car.\n\nOn the other hand, TheJournal.ie quoted the Irish Petroleum Industry Association as dismissive of the advice in the social media messages:\n\nOur members are implementing enhanced hygiene protocols in our service station shops. In line with HSE [Health and Safety Executive] advice, our workers regularly wash and sanitise their hands and the areas customers interact with such as fuel nozzles, credit card PIN pads, door handles and food areas.\nWe are aware of messages being shared on social media and wanted to inform customers that pump handles are no more or less prone to the spread of infection than any other hard surface and to outline the significant steps we are taking to combat the spread of Covid-19 and keep our valued customers safe.\n\nGas pumps could be considered somewhat more of a concern because consumers typically touch other surfaces \u2014 such as the door handles and interiors of their vehicles \u2014 immediately afterwards and could thereby create yet another pathway of contamination for themselves or others.  However, gas pumps are just one of many objects that multiple people commonly handle in similar fashion during the course of a day, including ATMs, payment processing systems, shopping cart handles, and currency, all of which pose varying degrees of risk.\nHow much potential for spreading the coronavirus any such object may present depends in large part on whether it\u2019s properly cleaned between uses, something that the public may not know (and should not bank on).  In general, the best advice is to wipe down surfaces you need to touch with disinfectant wipes, and don\u2019t touch your face or anything at home until you\u2019ve washed your hands thoroughly afterwards:\n\nJohn Eichberger, executive director of the nonprofit Fuels Institute, says gas station owners and operators are doing what they can to combat the spread of COVID-19 by cleaning their facilities more often. But that might not be enough assurance for some motorists.\n\u201cIf consumers are really worried about touching a gas pump handle, they can do what they do when they go to a grocery store and wipe down surfaces with disinfectant wipes when they need to touch something,\u201d Eichberger says.\nAnd as you would after any trip outside your home during this unusual time, remember to wash your hands before touching anything at home.": "", "A scam is asking people to input the personal details, including bank details, to receive \u201cCovid-19 Relieve.\u201d": "", "This is a scam and is not from the government": "", "This is correct.

The case is a 35-year-old female, Chinese national, residing in Wuhan, Hubei province in China.\nThat same day, a 35-year-old man who had recently returned to the United States from Wuhan, China, was also diagnosed with the disease. The New England Journal of Medicine reported:\nOn January 20, 2020, the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] confirmed that the patient\u2019s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.\nThe CDC announced that it had confirmed the first U.S. case of COVID-19 in a press release the following day, and a CDC spokesperson told Snopes.com that the patient tested positive for the novel coronavirus on the evening of Jan. 20. The press release came the following morning to give health officials time to notify the patient and discuss the special circumstances of the case.\u00a0\nWhile these countries both detected their first cases of COVID-19 on the same day, they took different approaches to treating the disease and have so far seen vastly different results. At the time of this writing on March 23, 2020, the number of cases in the U.S. had topped 35,000. South Korea had less than 9,000 cases and reported its lowest number of new cases since rates peaked at the end of February.\nOne possible explanation as to why South Korea was relatively successful in combating the disease, while the United States struggled to keep it contained during its initial weeks, may have to do with how each country reacted in the earliest days of the impending pandemic. In brief, South Korea\u2019s first action to fight the spread of COVID-19 was to aggressively start testing people for the disease and quarantine those who tested positive. The United States\u2019 first actions were aimed at restricting travel from China.\u00a0\nA special report from Reuters noted that South Korean health officials gathered in late January 2020 and decided that the need for testing was urgent. South Korea\u2019s CDC approved its first diagnostic test the following week, and by the end of February, drive-thru testing facilities that screened thousands of people a day were in operation.\u00a0\nThe United States took a different approach.\u00a0\nWhen the first patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 in the United States in January 2020, President Donald Trump announced a set of travel restrictions on Jan. 31, 2020, that prohibited travelers from arriving from China, the epicenter of the outbreak. The restrictions also required American citizens returning home from China to be screened at airports and monitored for 14 days after their arrival.\u00a0\nWhile the Trump administration did take action to combat the spread of COVID-19 shortly after the first patient was diagnosed in the U.S., the country did not, as South Korea did, immediately ramp up diagnostic testing. According to Reuters, South Korea conducted nearly 300,000 tests within two months of diagnosing their first COVID-19 patient. By contrast, the U.S. only conducted about 60,000 tests in that same time period.\nReuters reported (on March 18):\nSouth Korea\u2019s swift action stands in stark contrast to what has transpired in the United States. Seven weeks after the train station meeting, the Koreans have tested well over 290,000 people and identified over 8,000 infections. New cases are falling off: Ninety-three were reported Wednesday, down from a daily peak of 909 two weeks earlier.\nThe United States, whose first case was detected the same day as South Korea\u2019s, is not even close to meeting demand for testing. About 60,000 tests have been run by public and private labs in a country of 330 million, federal officials said Tuesday.\nThe spread of COVID-19 will undoubtedly be studied in greater detail, but we may not know the specific reasons as to why the disease spread the way it did in different locations for some time. However, the fact remains that while the United States and South Korea both confirmed their first cases of COVID-19 on the same day (Jan. 20, 2020), but the United States struggled to slow the spread of the disease in the same time period that South Korea was largely successful at mitigating its spread.": "", "Is 2m a safe social distance for coronavirus?": "", "\"I wish they [China] told us three months sooner that this [the coronavirus] was a problem.

If we find that the video was circulating before the event it supposedly shows, we can determine that the video was recaptioned and is being shared out of context. In this case, however, we were unable to trace these videos back to a date before the discovery of the coronavirus.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt appears that these videos were truly taken in January 2020 in various locations around China. According to social media reports, these videos first started circulating on apps such as TikTok and were originally posted by random citizens who had witnessed these events. However, that does not mean that the people featured in this video were infected with this virus.\u00a0\nIf we strip the above-displayed videos of their captions, we can take a look purely at what the videos show. In one case, it looks like a person was the victim of a traffic accident. In another, it appears that a man suffered a head injury.

The most commonly shared was a text post that typically read as follows:\n*Urgent: Health Bulletin to the Public *\n*Ministry of health\u2019s emergency notification to the public that the Coronavirus outbreak this time is very very serious & fatal.

It read as follows:\nPls tell ur families, relatives and friends\nMOH Health Bulletin to the Public:\nThe Upper Respiratory Infection affecting China at present is quite serious.

Let\u2019s continue to pray and wait for further notice about the infection.\u00a0\nPlease share.\u00a0\n\nNeither the printed email nor the viral Facebook message were official statements produced by any public health authority. The alert was apt to spread widely online precisely because it did not include any details about its supposed source, aside from mentioning a \u201cMinistry of Health\u201d in an unspecified country or region.\u00a0\nThe message also contained erroneous advice, claiming that readers could avoid contracting the virus by \u201ckeeping your throat moist,\u201d avoiding fried or spicy food, and taking vitamin-C supplements.\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the so-called \u201cnovel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\u201d outbreak is thought to have first been transmitted from animals to humans in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in China. Since then, it has spread from person to person. Previous coronaviruses like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have been transmitted between humans primarily through \u201crespiratory droplets\u201d \u2060\u2014 that is, coughs and sneezes.\u00a0\nThe CDC\u2019s general respiratory infection prevention advice applies to the 2019-nCoV outbreak, as follows:\n\n\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick.\nStay home when you are sick.\nCover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.\n\n\nNo evidence exists to indicate that any public health authority is officially advising the public that a dry throat makes individuals more vulnerable to contracting the virus, and that therefore drinking water is an effective prevention method, nor that vitamin C deficiency contributes to one\u2019s vulnerability to contracting the illness, nor that fried and spicy food are a medium for transmission of 2019-nCoV.": "", "Health experts predicted the new coronavirus could kill 65 million people.": "", "Did Health Experts \u2018Predict\u2019 New Coronavirus Could Kill 65 Million People?\nSome details from a mock health exercise were confused with real-world reports.\nAmid growing public anxiety about an outbreak of a new coronavirus originating in China in late January 2020, various media outlets reported on a dire warning that suggested the virus could kill 65 million people annually.\u00a0\nThe Daily Mail, for example, reported that health experts had \u201cpredicted\u201d the virus could kill 65 million people in a year. The publication later issued a correction and updated its article.\nSuch stories were prompted by a mock pandemic health exercise run by Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security on Oct. 18, 2019. But that exercise did not \u201cpredict\u201d the current virus would kill 65 million people.\nJohns Hopkins released a statement countering the viral news stories (emphasis added):\nIn October 2019, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security hosted a pandemic tabletop exercise called Event 201 with partners, the World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Recently, the Center for Health Security has received questions about whether that pandemic exercise predicted the current novel coronavirus outbreak in China. To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction. Instead, the exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that would likely arise in a very severe pandemic. We are not now predicting that the nCoV-2019 outbreak will kill 65 million people. Although our tabletop exercise included a mock novel coronavirus, the inputs we used for modeling the potential impact of that fictional virus are not similar to nCoV-2019.\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, coronaviruses are \u201ca large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS and SARS.\u201d\nThe coronavirus that was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in China, is a respiratory illness dubbed 2019-nCoV that had killed 213 people in China as of this writing.

While the AB-TC website does not carry any disclaimers labeling its content as fiction, we found a number of red flags concerning the legitimacy of this outlet\u2019s reporting.\u00a0\nFor starters, this website is full of junk news stories. For instance, a July 2010 article (still featured on the homepage) carries the headline, \u201cBREAKING: New York Giants coach Pat Shurmur has died.\u201d But Shurmur didn\u2019t die in 2010. In fact, he is still alive as of this writing and was hired as the offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos in January 2020.\nThe website has also published hoax articles about \u201ccannibal restaurants\u201d (debunked here), death hoaxes about celebrity couples (debunked here), doctored tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump, and a junk news article that falsely claimed Prince Andrew had committed suicide.\nThis website has also previously spread misinformation about the coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease. The government of Singapore released a statement on Jan. 30, 2020, to refute claims published in an AB-TC report:\nCorrections and clarifications regarding falsehoods published by AB-TC City News\u2019 website\nOn 30 Jan 2020, a website called \u2018City News\u2019 published an article titled \u201cBREAKING NEWS: Singapore records six more coronavirus case, total of 16 now\u201d (https://ab-tc.com/singapore-coronavirus-cases/) claiming that five Singaporeans have contracted the Wuhan coronavirus without going to China.\nAs of 9pm on 30 Jan 2020, there is no local transmission of the Wuhan virus in Singapore. All confirmed cases in Singapore to date are Chinese nationals who travelled from Wuhan.\nNone of the AB-TC articles we examined was accompanied by a person\u2019s byline. Rather, they were all written by so-called \u201clocal correspondents.\u201d\u00a0\nIn other words, this website doesn\u2019t exactly have a great track record of genuine news reporting.\u00a0\nIn addition to its history of pushing misinformation, there are also a few red flags in AB-TC\u2019s article about the mass killing of coronavirus patients. For instance, like most of the other articles on this website, this article contains no links back to supporting evidence. Even when the article mentions secondary sources, such as a \u201cdocument\u201d or a \u201cpress conference,\u201d they provide no evidence to show that these items actually exist or took place. The article is also suspiciously void of specifics. AB-TC reports that \u201cthe state\u201d or \u201cthe court\u201d or an \u201cofficial\u201d made a statement, but doesn\u2019t provide any direct quotes or names in its report.\u00a0\nLastly, no credible news outlets have published reports containing this claim. The New York Times reported on Feb. 6, 2020, that a senior official in China \u201cordered the authorities in the city of Wuhan to immediately round up all residents who have been infected with the coronavirus and place them in isolation, quarantine or designated hospitals.\u201d That report, of course, made no mention of \u201cmass killings.\u201d\nThere is also no mention of this supposed court case on the The Supreme People\u2019s Court of the People\u2019s Republic of China website.\u00a0\u00a0\nAB-TC is the sole source of this rumor. However, this website provided no evidence to support its claim. This website also has a history of spreading misinformation. As this claim is not supported by any other credible news reports, we\u2019ve concluded that this report is indeed false.": "", "The Chinese government is building a hospital in 10 days to deal with the new coronavirus.": "", "Is China Building a Hospital in 10 Days to Treat Coronavirus Patients?\nMillions of people are quarantined in China to prevent the spread of the virus.\nAs an outbreak of a severe strain of the new coronavirus spread in the city of Wuhan, China, the Chinese government vowed to build in 10 days a 1,000-bed hospital to treat victims of the illness.\nGiven the massive undertaking, Snopes readers asked whether this was true.

While the humorous nature of the post seemed rather obvious, search queries from people concerned with Eminem\u2019s health quickly registered here at Snopes.\u00a0\nEminem did not contract coronavirus. This silly piece of text is just a joke that repurposed some of Eminem\u2019s lyrics.

All of these claims were false.\nOf course, the 2020 outbreak of coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease, was no joke. As of this writing, more than 30,000 people worldwide were reported to have been infected and more than 600 had died as a result in China.

The implication here appears to be that doctors are killing patients as opposed to treating them. However, this video appears to show police officers dressed in medical gear, not medical professionals.\u00a0\nWhile we have not been able to find the source of this video, Getty Images does have a few photographs of police officers in Wuhan, China, wearing similar protective clothing. Furthermore, the word \u201cpolice\u201d can be briefly seen on the hood of this car.\u00a0\n\nClip 2\nAre these gunshots being fired to deter people from leaving quarantine?\nRating: Miscaptioned.\nThe second clip in this video was widely shared as if it showed doctors treating coronavirus patients on the street as gunshots could be heard in the background. One Twitter user wrote:\nNew video from the quarantine zone in China. Medical personal checking #coronavirus patients. There\u2019re multiple reports from the ground of people dying in their homes. The gunshots you hear in the background is to stop those who want to escape from off-road terrain.\nThere was no evidence to support speculation that the blasts in the background were gunshots, that these gunshots were being fired to prevent people from fleeing the area, or that people laying in the streets are coronavirus victims.\u00a0\nNobody can be seen on screen holding a gun, and the people shown in the video do not seem particularly disturbed by the supposed \u201cgunfire.\u201d This video also started circulating on or around Jan. 25, 2020, when China was celebrating Lunar New Year.

However, it is not related to the coronavirus nor to a roadblock. This video actually shows a person who was killed in a motorbike accident.\u00a0\nRemnants of this accident can be seen in the video. At one point, a busted up sidewalk can be seen near the victim. An overturned scooter can also be seen in the background. The French news outlet Les Observateurs France 24 obtained a slightly longer version of this video that more clearly shows the crashed motorbike.\u00a0\nLes Observateurs also obtained a statement from the director of the Wuzu police station who said that this was a \u201cone-vehicle road accident\u201d:\u00a0\n\u201cIn the afternoon of January 29, a one-sided [one-vehicle] road accident occurred in the city of Wuzu. The person involved was driving a scooter and, due to bad traffic maneuver, she shifted to the side of the road, collided with the stones along the ledge and fell on the back of the head, and unfortunately died. The driver was solely responsible. Local police and health center workers quickly arrived to handle the accident.\u201d\nIn Summary\nAlthough Wuhan, China, and surrounding areas were certainly dealing with an outbreak of coronavirus in early 2020, and while some of the photographs and videos coming out of China are undoubtedly real, many clips have been captioned in a way to capitalize on the fear of this potential pandemic.\nWhen we examined another set of videos that supposedly showed people collapsing in the street as a result of contracting coronavirus, for instance, we found that these claims were based purely on the spectator\u2019s assumptions and not any first-hand knowledge. The World Health Organization said that it would be \u201catypical\u201d for people to collapse in this manner from the virus.\u00a0\nFind more information on coronavirus here.": "", "miscaptioned": "", "Chinese doctors confirmed that African people are \"genetically resistant\" to new coronavirus.": "", "Did Chinese Doctors Confirm African People Are Genetically Resistant to Coronavirus?\nMisinformation about the coronavirus outbreak seems to have traveled farther than the virus itself.\nIn early 2020, an outbreak of new coronavirus in Wuhan, China, sparked fears that the virus could cause a pandemic. It also inspired a significant amount of misinformation.\nFor example, on Feb. 17, 2020, the website Cityscrollz.com falsely reported that a Cameroonian college student studying in China contracted coronavirus but recovered \u201cbecause of his blood genetic composition which is mainly found in the genetic composition of subsaharan Africans.\u201d\nIf such a claim, that people from African backgrounds are more resistant to coronavirus than others, were true, one would expect it to be a major news story. Instead, it\u2019s being reported exclusively in viral social media posts and junk sites. That\u2019s because it\u2019s not true.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), anyone who comes into close contact with someone infected with the coronavirus is at risk for contracting it.\nThat said, it is true that Kem Senou Pavel Daryl, a 21-year-old Cameroon national studying in China, became ill after contracting coronavirus and was hospitalized. His recovery was not the result of a superior immune system possessed by people hailing from African countries but, according to news reports, rounds of antibiotics and other drugs.\nAs BBC News reported, Senou recovered after being placed in isolation for 13 days. \u201cThe CT scan showed no trace of the illness. He became the first African person known to be infected with the deadly coronavirus and the first to recover. His medical care was covered by the Chinese state.\u201d\nAs of this writing, the coronavirus outbreak has killed 1,770 people in mainland China.
