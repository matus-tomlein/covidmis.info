            The total number of deaths from Covid-19 in the UK is now at 233, the same number of deaths reported in Italy about two weeks ago.
        </h4>

        <p>
            These numbers about Covid-19 deaths in the UK and Italy are broadly accurate
        </p>

        <div class="text-center text-warning text-large m-2 p-2">
            Verdict:
            Correct. On 21 March, Public Health England reported a total of 233 deaths in the UK from Covid-19. However, not enough is known to say whether the number of deaths will grow at the same rate in the UK as in Italy.
