        <p>
            This post about Covid-19 and blood clotting conditions contains inaccuracies

        <div class="text-center text-warning text-large m-2 p-2">
            Verdict:
            It is incorrect to say that Covid-19 patients have been misdiagnosed with pneumonia when they have disseminated intravascular coagulation. Severe Covid-19 can cause pneumonia as well as blood clotting problems.
