            This is according to a new piece of statistical research, but this research has been challenged by other scientists and is highly uncertain. Other early estimates have estimated the prevalence to be lower, but it’s impossible to tell how accurate these will turn out to be.

            At the time this claim was made, the government’s “official” published count of Covid-19 deaths was slightly under the number of deaths during the Blitz, although the numbers are very similar. The true number of deaths related to Covid-19 is likely to be higher than the toll during the Blitz.
