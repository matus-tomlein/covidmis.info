            New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has ordered all MPs to take a 20% pay cut during Covid-19 crisis.
        </h4>

        <p>
            Not all New Zealand MPs have been ordered to take a pay cut, and UK MPs have not awarded themselves a £10,000 bonus

        <div class="text-center text-warning text-large m-2 p-2">
            Verdict:
            Ms Ardern has given herself, government ministers and public service chief executives a 20% pay cut. This does not cover all MPs.

            Incorrect. MPs’ pay is regulated by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which has increased the amount MPs can claim in expenses for office and staff costs by £10,000 to cover additional costs needed to set up remote working.  MPs did not get to decide on this increase and  do not have to claim it.
