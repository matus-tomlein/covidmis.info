            Covid-19 is the underlying cause of death for most people who die with it

            Verdict:
            This was the correct number of Covid-19 deaths (but only among hospital patients) where no pre-existing condition was reported, up to 26 May. But this data isn’t the deaths “only” from coronavirus and doesn’t tell us what the underlying cause of death was. Covid-19 death was determined by a positive test result or where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.
