span in Italy as a result of the disease.\nSadly it is true that between March 10 and March 11, 2020, 196 people died in Italy, which was suffering the worst outbreak of COVID-19 outside Asia.\nReuters reported on March 11 that, \u201cThe death toll from coronaviruses in Italy has risen from 196 to 827, an increase of 31%, Civil Protection [Agency] announced today.\u201d\nThe situation worsened the next day as an additional spate of deaths was reported. On March 12, The New York Times reported, \u201cThe death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy has jumped in the last 24 hours by 189 to 1,016, a rise of 23%, the Civil Protection Agency said.\u201d\nItaly was struggling to keep pace with the disease, running low on hospital beds and equipment to treat the rapidly-spreading virus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China in late 2019.\nThe news of these fatalities came amid announcements in the United States that everything from basketball tournaments to Disneyland were shutting down in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.\nU.S. health officials estimate that COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus, is roughly ten times more deadly than the seasonal flu.", "published_at": "2020-03-12T23:00:00+00:00", "url":

declared the spread of COVID-19 a pandemic in early March 2020, alarmed readers asked Snopes to verify reports that nearly 200 people died in a 24-hour span in Italy as a result of the disease.\nSadly it is true that between March 10 and March 11, 2020, 196 people died in Italy, which was suffering the worst outbreak of COVID-19 outside Asia.\nReuters reported on March 11 that, \u201cThe death toll from coronaviruses in Italy has risen from 196 to 827, an increase of 31%, Civil Protection [Agency] announced today.\u201d\nThe situation worsened the next day as an additional spate of deaths was reported. On March 12, The New York Times reported, \u201cThe death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy has jumped in the last 24 hours by 189 to 1,016, a rise of 23%, the Civil Protection Agency said.\u201d\nItaly was struggling to keep pace with the disease, running low on hospital beds and equipment to treat the rapidly-spreading virus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China in late 2019.\nThe news of these fatalities came amid announcements in the United States that everything from basketball tournaments to Disneyland were shutting down in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.\nU.S. health officials estimate that COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus, is roughly ten times more deadly than the seasonal flu.", "published_at": "2020-03-12T23:00:00+00:00", "url":

ibuprofen to relieve pain and fever associated with COVID-19 infections.", "description": "Should COVID-19 Patients Avoid Taking Ibuprofen?\nFrench medical advice warned that \"adverse effects\" of drugs such as ibuprofen had been reported in coronavirus patients.\nAdding to the extant confusion swirling about the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic in March 2020, the French government, including Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran, issued warnings advising that infected persons should avoid taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen:\n\nSerious adverse events related to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients with COVID19, possible or confirmed cases. We remind you that the treatment of a poorly tolerated fever or pain in the context of COVID19 or any other respiratory virosis is based on paracetamol, without exceeding the dose of 60 mg/kg/day and 3g/day. NSAIDs should be banned.\n\nCOVID-19 \u2014 Taking anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, cortisone, \u2026) could be a factor in worsening the infection. If you have a fever, take paracetamol [also known as acetaminophen]. If you are already on anti-inflammatory drugs or in doubt, ask your doctor for advice.\nDr. Amir Khan, a National Health Service (NHS) doctor and a senior university lecturer in the U.K., offered the following explanation about why taking anti-inflammatory drugs might have a deleterious effect on persons dealing with a COVID-19 infection:\nDespite all of their beneficial effects, it has long been known that anti-inflammatories can have a depressive effect on parts of our immune systems.\nWhen it comes to taking them to help ease the symptoms of the common cold, we do not really have to worry about this slight but important reduction in the strength of our immune systems: We are very unlikely to develop complications from the common cold, let alone die from it.\nBut we need our immune system in top working order in order to battle the coronavirus and win.\nWhen the virus enters the human body, it induces mild to severe respiratory problems...", "published_at":

The thread further suggested that a likely explanation for this alleged observation was the cremation of bodies associated with the outbreak of the new coronavirus whose origin is in that region:\n\nThe Sun and The Express, among other outlets, uncritically repeated this claim, despite its dubious origins. Both outlets later deleted their stories without a correction note by the time of our reporting. The Sun, for example, had described the above image as showing the \u201cextent of corpse burning in Wuhan.\u201d That premise is fatally flawed for at least two reasons.\nFirst and most significantly: The data presented are not a real-time observation of sulfur concentrations above Wuhan. Instead, the image is a computer-model output designed to predict, based on a historical knowledge of the area and its current atmospheric conditions, what concentration of sulfur is likely present in the air at a given time and place. Second, sulfur is not a significant emission from human cremation. It is, however, a significant emission from the burning of coal in power plants or for other industrial uses like iron and steel production. The area directly below the hotspot shown in Twitter thread is, in fact, the Wuhan Iron & Steel Company.\nProblem One: Not an Actual Observation of Sulfur Dioxide Concentrations\nThe source of the data highlighted in the Twitter thread is a company named Windy.com, which combines several models and meteorological inputs to create global maps of weather conditions aimed primarily at people who partake in outdoor sports. Windy, in turn, gets its sulfur data from a NASA climate model named GEOS-5.
