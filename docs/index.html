                Did Health Experts ‘Predict’ New Coronavirus Could Kill 65 Million People?
Some details from a mock health exercise were confused with real-world reports.
Amid growing public anxiety about an outbreak of a new coronavirus originating in China in late January 2020, various media outlets reported on a dire warning that suggested the virus could kill 65 million people annually.

A video clip supposedly showing the exponential spread of a new coronavirus misled some viewers.
In February 2020, as fears about the spread of a new coronavirus reached a fever pitch, a video clip circulated on social media supposedly showing how this disease was spreading farther and faster than previous epidemics.
The video, which has racked up nearly 2 million views, supposedly shows how diseases such as Ebola, SARS, MERS, swin
